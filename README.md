# Hi there, I’m Ashvak Govindarajula 👋

**Data & Analytics Engineer | 3+ years building production-grade pipelines, BI systems & ERP reporting for insurance and clean energy sectors**

I specialize in turning fragmented operational and finance data into decision-ready metrics, designing ELT pipelines (AWS, dbt, Snowflake/Redshift) and building self-service BI (Power BI, DAX, star schemas) used by non-technical stakeholders.

### Background

- **Allianz Partners Health** – claims, risk & revenue analytics (€50M+ portfolios)
- **Nikkiso Clean Energy** – ERP analytics & project finance BI (€35M+ projects)

This GitHub showcases **how I think, structure data, and ship analytics**, not just tools.

## ⚙️ Skills & Tools

- **Programming & Query Languages:** Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy), SQL (Snowflake, PostgreSQL), Bash
- **Data Engineering & Analytics:** dbt, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, AWS Glue & Lambda, Apache Airflow, Kafka, Kinesis
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI, Tableau, Looker, DAX
- **DevOps & Cloud:** AWS (S3, EC2, IAM), Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- **Other:** REST APIs, CI/CD, Agile/Scrum

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

| Project | Description & Business Impact |
| --- | --- |
| **[Clickstream Data Pipeline](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Clickstream_Data-Pipeline)** | Designed a **real-time clickstream processing pipeline** on AWS using Kinesis, Lambda, Glue and Redshift. Automated ingestion, cleansing and aggregation; implemented dbt models for downstream analytics. This pattern mirrors how I built production log pipelines for web products. |
| **[dbt Project for Snowflake](https://github.com/Ashvakg/dbt-snowflake)** | Production-grade dbt project with modular models, tests and documentation on Snowflake. Demonstrates version-controlled transformations, environment management and continuous deployment via GitHub Actions – similar to the analytics engineering patterns I've deployed in finance and operations. |
| **[Claims Performance Analysis](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Claims-Performance-Analysis)** | End-to-end analysis of insurance claims data. Built ETL pipelines in Python to clean and transform raw datasets, created interactive dashboards in Power BI to track KPIs and recommended improvements. Inspired by my work at Allianz Partners Health. |
| **[Just Eat / Lieferando Delivery Pipeline](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Zomato-Delivery-Efficiency_Analyzing-and-Predicting-Factors)** | Built a machine-learning pipeline to **predict delivery times** for food orders. Cleaned and engineered features from order and traffic data, trained regression models in Python and visualized results. If I were to deploy this in production, I'd integrate with Airflow and implement feature pipelines and monitoring. |
