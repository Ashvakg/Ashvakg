# Hi there, I’m Ashvak Govindarajula 👋

**Data Engineer & Data Analyst | Passionate about building scalable data pipelines, delivering actionable insights and automating workflows**

I’m a data professional with experience in **data engineering** (building ETL/ELT pipelines, working with AWS & Snowflake, and implementing best practices with dbt) and **data analytics** (SQL, Python, Power BI). I enjoy designing end‑to‑end solutions that transform raw data into valuable insights and am always exploring new technologies in the cloud and analytics space.

## ⚙️ Skills & Tools

- **Programming:** Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy), SQL (Snowflake, PostgreSQL), Bash
- **Data Engineering:** dbt, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, AWS Glue & Lambda, Apache Airflow, Kafka/Kinesis
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI, Tableau, Looker
- **DevOps & Cloud:** AWS (S3, EC2, IAM), Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- **Other:** REST APIs, CICD, Agile/Scrum

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

Here are some of the projects I’m most proud of—each one showcases a different aspect of my data engineering and analytics skill set.

| Project | Description & Tech Stack |
| --- | --- |
| **[Claims‑Performance‑Analysis](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Claims-Performance-Analysis)** | End‑to‑end analysis of insurance claims data. Built **ETL pipelines** in Python to clean and transform raw datasets, created **interactive dashboards** in Power BI to track key performance indicators (KPI) and recommended improvements based on insights. |
| **[Clickstream Data Pipeline](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Clickstream_Data-Pipeline)** | Designed a **real‑time clickstream processing pipeline** on AWS using **Kinesis**, **Lambda**, **Glue**, and **Redshift**. Automated data ingestion, cleansing and aggregation, and implemented **dbt models** for downstream analytics. |
| **[DBT Project for Snowflake](https://github.com/Ashvakg/dbt-snowflake)** | Implemented a production‑grade dbt project with modular models, tests and documentation on **Snowflake**. Demonstrated **version‑controlled transformations**, environment management and continuous deployment using **GitHub Actions**. |
| **[Helpline Dashboard](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Helpline-Dashboard)** | Created a **full‑stack dashboard** to monitor call‑center operations. Used **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to model and visualize call metrics, enabling data‑driven staffing decisions. |
| **[Work‑Location Trends](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Work-Location-Trends_Power-BI)** | Analyzed remote vs. office work trends using public datasets. Developed an **interactive Power BI report** and wrote DAX calculations to highlight patterns across industries and geographies. |
| **[Zomato Delivery Efficiency](https://github.com/Ashvakg/Zomato-Delivery-Efficiency_Analyzing-and-Predicting-Factors)** | Built a machine‑learning pipeline to **predict delivery times** for food orders. Cleaned and engineered features from order and traffic data, trained regression models in Python and visualized results using **matplotlib & seaborn**. |
