# Hi, I’m Ashvak Govindarajula 👋  
### I build analytics systems that executives actually trust.

**Data & Analytics Engineer | Finance, Operations & ERP Analytics | AWS · dbt · Power BI**

I specialize in **turning fragmented, messy operational and finance data into decision-grade analytics** — not dashboards for the sake of dashboards, but systems leadership uses to steer **money, risk, and delivery**.

Over the last 3+ years, I’ve worked at the intersection of **data engineering, BI, and business execution**, owning analytics end-to-end:
raw ERP & event data → validated models → KPIs → executive decisions.

---

## What I actually do (beyond tools)

Most analytics initiatives fail not because of SQL or cloud — but because:
- data isn’t trustworthy  
- KPIs aren’t aligned  
- ownership is unclear  

This is where I focus.

- Design **lean data models** that survive real business edge cases  
- Build **ELT pipelines** that are observable, testable, and boring to maintain  
- Translate business questions (risk, margin, delays) into **clear metrics**  
- Ship **self-service BI** that non-technical teams actually adopt

## Background (real production work)

**Allianz Partners Health**  
Claims, risk & revenue analytics across **€50M+ insurance portfolios**  
→ anomaly detection, KPI standardization, executive dashboards

**Nikkiso Clean Energy**  
ERP & project finance analytics across **€50M+ industrial projects**  
→ Dynamics 365 data, cost variance, burn rate, delivery risk tracking

I’ve been the **person accountable when numbers had financial consequences** — not just a report builder.

## Selected Projects (why they exist, not just what they use)

> These are not tutorials. Each project mirrors problems I’ve solved in production.

### 🔹 Clickstream Data Pipeline (AWS)
**Real-time event ingestion → analytics-ready models**

- Designed a streaming pipeline using **Kinesis, Lambda, Glue, Redshift**
- Modeled raw events into analytics-ready fact tables with **dbt**
- Focused on **schema evolution, data quality, and downstream usability**

➡️ Mirrors how I design production event pipelines for product & ops analytics

---

### 🔹 Production-grade dbt Project (Snowflake)
**Analytics engineering done properly**

- Modular dbt models with tests, documentation, and environments
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Emphasis on **governance and maintainability**, not just transformations

➡️ Same patterns I apply to finance and ERP analytics  
🔗 https://github.com/Ashvakg/dbt-snowflake

---

### 🔹 Claims Performance Analysis (Insurance)
**From raw claims data → business decisions**

- Python ETL to clean and validate insurance datasets
- Power BI dashboards tracking loss ratios, claim frequency, cost drivers
- KPI logic inspired directly by Allianz production work

➡️ Demonstrates domain translation, not generic BI  
🔗 https://github.com/Ashvakg/Claims-Performance-Analysis

---

### 🔹 Delivery Time Prediction (Food Logistics)
**ML with business judgment (not ML theater)**

- Feature engineering on traffic, distance, and order data
- Regression models to predict delivery times
- Clear discussion of **what it would take to productionize** (orchestration, monitoring, feature pipelines)

➡️ Shows decision-making, not just model accuracy

## How to read this GitHub

If you’re a recruiter or hiring manager:

- Read the **README files inside projects** — that’s how I think  
- Notice the focus on **data quality, modeling, and decisions**

This GitHub exists to answer one question:  
**“Would I trust this person with business-critical data?”**
